  # Choose what kind of storage to use for this uploader:
  storage :file
  # storage :fog

  # This is a sensible default for uploaders that are meant to be mounted:
  def store_dir

  # Provide a default URL as a default if there hasn't been a file uploaded:

  # Process files as they are uploaded:
   process :resize_to_fit => [400, 400]
  #
  # def scale(width, height)
  #   # do something
  # end

  # Create different versions of your uploaded files:
  version :thumb do
    process :resize_to_fill => [80,123]
  end

  # Add a white list of extensions which are allowed to be uploaded.
  # For images you might use something like this:
  def extension_white_list
    %w(jpg jpeg png)
  end

  # Override the filename of the uploaded files:
  # Avoid using model.id or version_name here, see uploader/store.rb for details.
  # Set the filename for versioned files
